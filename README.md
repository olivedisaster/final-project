***Sports Betting Machine Learning Project***

  - Train algorithm on 2010-2018, then test on 2019. 
  - Run model on 32 games separately (Round 1), Run model on 16 games (Round 2), etc. - *ACCURACY SCORE*
  - Use XGboost
  - Clean data comes from Kaggle.
  - Once we have a model, predict a game from the day of or the night before.


The goal of this project was to utilize a machine learning model that can predict the winner of an NBA game.
